The Kuzushiji-49 dataset contains 232,365 Japanese characters in the training data alone. The original author of this dataset states there may be mulitiple ways of writing certain characters (called Hentaigana, a typical feature of ancient Japanese writing). However, data labels do not account for these different styles and collapse all the Hentaigana into 1 label.

It is the interest of this project to identify and extract these different writing styles to see if prior knowledge of these differences will lead to more accurate classification. I employ unsupervised clustering methods pipeline, including K-means, Guassian Mixture, and t-SNE. Specifically, I experiment with tuning the parameters of the t-SNE to better visualize the high-dimensional patterns in the images. Since t-SNE is not invertible, I simultaneously tune other, invertile, clustering methods for a best-guess match to t-SNE, in an attempt to capture stand-out clusters which may be Hentaigana. Accuracy is gauged using Pycart, which streamlines the modeling process and allows the convienent comparison of many models accross a range of metrics. 

This project was inspired by my undergraduate machine learning course and my goal is to improve my understanding of unsupervised learning methods and working with large datasets.
